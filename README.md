In this task, I was challenged to create an 'endless runner' type game where the goal is simply to live for as long as possible. Much like those app games you find on mobile, such as Subway Surfers.

I've since come back and done some touch-ups to make it more presentable; please feel free to look around!

This is my best-looking game yet, and because of that, it's also the most presentable. Here are some of the shaders I've done in Unity to make some of the effects you see in the game.
